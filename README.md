Title: 

Refactoring CSS and HTML code on Horiseon homepage for increased accessibility.

Description: 
This project was created to update site accessibility to meet current standards, increase search-engine optimization for the site, ensure readability and functioning features for the user, and to increase efficiency in the HTML and CSS code. 

1. Make the code more accessible for readers with disabilities. 
    * Added accessible alt attributes to all images and icons. This allows assistive technologies to describe images and icons.

    * Replaced custom class-defined elements with standard HTML elements such as <header><footer><section><nav>. This allows the computer to better relay information through assistive technologies.
2. Increase search-engine optimization of website:
    * Added alt attributes to images and icons as key words and descriptions that can be searched.
    * Updated title of webpage to increase SEO and navigation to website. 
3. More concise and efficient code
    * Ordered HTML elements and CSS attributes in a logical top-down layout.
    * Combined sections "search engine optimization" "social media marketing" and "online reputation" into HTML elements "content" and "content-box".
    * Added comments in HTML and CSS code marking where sections start and end. 
    * Fixed an error in the navigation section by linking class id of main content sections to navigation headings. When you click on a list item in the navigation heading (Search Engine Optiization, Online Reputation Management, or Social Media Marketing) the page scrolls to the corresponding section on the screen.
