<b>Refactoring CSS and HTML code on Horiseon homepage for increased accessibility.</b>

<b>Description:</b>
This project was created to update site accessibility to meet current standards, increase search-engine optimization for the site, ensure readability and functioning features for the user, and to increase efficiency in the HTML and CSS code. 

<i>1. Make the code more accessible for readers with disabilities.</i> 

    * Added accessible alt attributes to all images and icons. This allows assistive technologies to describe images and icons.

    * Replaced custom class-defined elements with standard HTML elements such as header, footer, section, and navigation. This allows the computer to better relay information through assistive technologies.

<i>2. Increase search-engine optimization of website.</i>

    * Added alt attributes to images and icons as key words and descriptions that can be searched.

    * Updated title of webpage to increase SEO and navigation to website. 

<i>3. Create more concise and efficient code.</i>

    * Ordered HTML elements and CSS attributes in a logical top-down layout.

    * Combined sections "search engine optimization" "social media marketing" and "online reputation" into HTML elements "content" and "content-box" to consolidate css classes.

    * Added comments in HTML and CSS code marking where sections start and end.

    * Fixed an error in the navigation section by linking class id of main content sections to navigation headings. When you click on a list item in the navigation heading (Search Engine Optiization, Online Reputation Management, or Social Media Marketing) the page now scrolls to the corresponding section on the screen.
